# Privacy Policy for ReadItLater

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2025

## Introduction
The **ReadItLater** app ("we," "our," or "us") is designed to help you save, organize, and manage web links efficiently. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

## Data Collection and Storage
**ReadItLater** is a **local-first application**. This means:
*   **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data, saved links, tags, or usage specifics to any external servers or third parties.
*   **Local Storage:** All the links you save, tags you create, and your app preferences are stored exclusively on your device's internal memory using a local database (SQLite).

## Permissions and Usage
The app requires specific permissions to function correctly:

1.  **Storage / File Access:**
    *   **Purpose:** To enable the **Backup and Restore** features. We need access to your device's file system to export your saved links to a text file ("backup") or to read a file you select to import links ("restore").
    *   **Usage:** We only access the specific files you select or create for these purposes.

2.  **Shared Data (Intents):**
    *   **Purpose:** To allow you to save links directly from other apps (like your browser or YouTube) to ReadItLater.
    *   **Usage:** When you "Share" a link to our app, we process the shared text/URL solely to create a new entry in your local database. This data is not sent anywhere else.

3.  **Open Links:**
    *   **Purpose:** To allow you to visit the websites you have saved.
    *   **Usage:** When you open a link, the app redirects you to your device's default web browser. We do not track your browsing history.

## Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase) or advertising networks. Your usage data remains private on your device.

## Children's Privacy
Since our application does not collect any personal data and is designed for general utility, it is safe for use by all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy mainly through app updates.
